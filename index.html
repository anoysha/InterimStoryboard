        <h2>INT. HOSTEL ROOM - NIGHT</h2>
        <p>WE OPEN in a well illuminated room, the protagonist is sitting at her desk. She works for a few minutes and shuts the laptop flap down as she gets tired of typing. She picks up her iPad and opens Netflix hoping to find something interesting to watch.

As minutes pass, she continues scrolling, unable to find anything that catches her eye and keeps scrolling through the plethora of options available to her. Frustrated, she puts the iPad down and leans back in her chair, and closes her eyes.</p>

        <h2>INT. HOSTEL ROOM - DAY</h2>
        <p>The next morning, the protagonist wakes up to her alarm, disoriented as she scurries out of her bed. As she begins getting ready, every little choice feels like a crisis. As she brushes her teeth, she looks in the mirror, her reflection seems strange. But she shrugs it off, and moves on to wash her face. She opens her closet and stands there as she wonders what to wear.</p>
        <p> She is met with one dilemma after another. Which shoes to wear with her outfit ? What snack to bring to class? 
The decisions pile up, and they all seem impossible. She wears her shoes, picks up her bag and walks out of the door.</p>

Her mind is elsewhere. She looks left and right, wanting a break, she gets up to go to the bathroom. But as she walks out, something’s wrong. She’s not in the hallway anymore…</p>

She taps her pen absentmindedly on the desk, physically present but mentally absent. When she finally does make it to class, she can’t focus. Her mind is elsewhere. She gets up to go to the bathroom, but as she steps out, something’s wrong. She’s not in the hallway anymore...</p>

        <p>She’s standing in the middle of a dense forest, surrounded by towering trees. She doesn’t know how she got there. A bird watches as she stumbles through the forest, observing quietly. Panic creeps in as she wanders, unsure of where to go. After what feels like hours, she stops in front of a fallen tree. She stares at it, and suddenly—everything changes.</p>
