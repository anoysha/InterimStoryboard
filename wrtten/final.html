        <h2>INT. HOSTEL ROOM - NIGHT</h2>
        <p>WE OPEN in a well-illuminated room. The protagonist is sitting at her desk, her face illuminated by the subtle glow of her laptop screen. She works for a few minutes and shuts the laptop flap down as she gets tired of typing. She picks up her iPad and opens Netflix in the hopes of finding something interesting to watch in her break. As minutes pass, she continues scrolling, unable to find anything that catches her eye. Frustrated, she shuts the iPad and leans back in her chair, rubbing her eyes as they wear out from exhaustion.</p>

        <h2>INT. HOSTEL ROOM - DAY</h2>
        <p>The next morning, we see the faint illumination of a phone screen as it vibrates on the side table. The protagonist wakes up to her alarm, disoriented and panicked, as she scurries out of bed. As she begins getting ready, every little choice feels like a crisis. She opens her closet and stands there motionless, wondering which top to wear and which watch goes best with it.</p>
        <p>The dilemmas pile up: what color eyeshadow to use? Which shoes to wear? What snack to bring to class? Which perfume? The decisions seem impossible. When she looks in the mirror, her reflection seems strange. She shrugs it off, picks up her bag, and walks out the door.</p>

        <h2>EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY</h2>
        <p>The protagonist struggles on her way to class—she’s late again and can’t find her way. Moving quickly but with an odd urgency, she stops, scans the area, pulls out her phone, and then looks even more confused. She retraces her steps, walking back and forth, unsure of where she’s going.</p>

        <h2>INT. CLASSROOM, HALLWAY - DAY</h2>
        <p>She stands by the classroom door for a second, scans the room, and chooses a seat in the back. Her posture is slumped, her gaze unfocused. She taps her pen absentmindedly on the desk, physically present but mentally absent. When she finally does make it to class, she can’t focus. Her mind is elsewhere. She gets up to go to the bathroom, but as she steps out, something’s wrong. She’s not in the hallway anymore...</p>

        <h2>EXT. FOREST - DAY</h2>
        <p>She’s standing in the middle of a dense forest, surrounded by towering trees. She doesn’t know how she got there. A bird watches as she stumbles through the forest, observing quietly. Panic creeps in as she wanders, unsure of where to go. After what feels like hours, she stops in front of a fallen tree. She stares at it, and suddenly—everything changes.</p>
